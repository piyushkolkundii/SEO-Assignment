   <h2> What is the benefit of meta tag in HTML?</h2>
 <br>
Meta tags are important because they impact how your site appears in the   SERPs and how many people will be inclined to click through to your website. They will therefore impact your traffic and engagement rates, which can impact your SEO and rankings. 
<br>Meta tags are an important part of a solid SEO strategy. <br>
The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data  (information) about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element,  and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
